                        Since 2012, <strong>Petite Treats</strong> have been serving only 
                        the freshest baked breads in all of Kirwan.

                    Come on over for the morning and have a steaming cup of coffee (or) tea
                    of your desire alongside with a toast toasted in perfection; not too toasted
                    and not too light; just as you like it. Relax and be in the present before
                    starting off to your usual busy hustle life. <br>
                    Never have we ever had a single complaint about our bakeries. YES! It
                    is that good, that promising so much that our customers are always
                    satisfied with whatever they have.
